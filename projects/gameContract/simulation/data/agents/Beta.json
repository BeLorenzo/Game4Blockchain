Identify the worst possible outcome for each available option\n2. Choose the option where the worst case is least damaging\n3. Avoid any choice that has resulted in catastrophic loss (>50% of stake)\n4. Assume all other players will act against your interests\n5. Prioritize capital preservation over growth\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT:\n- Ban options that caused losses >10 ALGO for at least 3 rounds\n- Accept small guaranteed losses over risky potential gains\n- Never bet more than 20% of available capital on uncertain outcomes\n- Exit positions early if they show signs of failure\n\nSTRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:\n- Trust no one until they prove trustworthy through repeated cooperation\n- Build safety buffers and emergency reserves\n- In multi-round games, survive first, profit second\n- Prefer predictable small wins over volatile large opportunities",
