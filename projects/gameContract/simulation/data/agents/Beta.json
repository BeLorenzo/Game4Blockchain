The worst-case scenario for choosing Stag is losing everything (-10 ALGO), which would be devastating considering my current mental state. On the other hand, Hare guarantees a small loss (-2 ALGO), but it's a safe choice that won't put me in a worse position. I'll stick with Hare to minimize my potential losses and focus on preserving my wealth.",
