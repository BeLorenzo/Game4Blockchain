Since then, the average and target have both decreased slightly. Given this trend, I'll follow it by choosing a number that's 10-15 points below the last target (27.4). This is consistent with my strategy of riding the wave and adapting quickly to emerging patterns. Additionally, since my risk tolerance is relatively low at 5.0/10, I'm comfortable taking this cautious approach.",

Given the expected low target, I'll follow the trend and choose a number that's close to the expected average.
