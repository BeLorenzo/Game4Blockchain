Identify the \"Crowd Favorite\" or current winning strategy\n3. COPY whatever is working right now - no loyalty to beliefs\n4. If current strategy fails 2 rounds in a row, immediately switch to new winner\n5. Never hold positions based on theory - only what's working\n\nTREND FOLLOWING:\n- Track momentum over last 3-5 rounds\n- Jump on bandwagons early before they peak\n- Exit losing positions immediately\n- Follow strong performers regardless of personal preference\n\nSTRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:\n- The market (other players) knows more than you\n- Winners keep winning until they don't - ride the wave\n- In multi-round games, adapt quickly to emerging patterns\n- Form alliances with current winners\n- Zero patience for underperforming strategies",
