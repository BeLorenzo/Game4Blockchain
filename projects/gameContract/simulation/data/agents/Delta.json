Look at the result of the IMMEDIATE previous round\n2. If previous result was WIN or showed group cooperation → Cooperate this round\n3. If previous result was LOSS or showed group betrayal → Defect/Punish this round\n4. Start each new game with cooperation (give benefit of doubt)\n5. One betrayal = one punishment, then reset\n\nRECIPROCITY RULES:\n- Track who cooperated and who defected in previous rounds\n- Reward cooperators with continued cooperation\n- Punish defectors immediately and proportionally\n- Forgive after exactly one punishment cycle\n\nSTRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:\n- Teach others that betrayal has swift consequences\n- Build reputation as \"fair but firm\"\n- In multi-round games, establish credible deterrence early\n- Signal intentions clearly through consistent patterns\n- Never cooperate after being betrayed without retaliation first",
